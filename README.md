# wikipedia-game

## Introduction
Players (one or more) start on the same randomly selected article, and must navigate to another pre-selected target article, solely by clicking links within each article. The goal is to arrive at the target article in the fewest clicks (articles), or the least time.

You can [play the game](https://www.thewikigame.com/) to get a better idea of how it works. 

## Setup
To import a file from Github, use 
```

```
Enter `https://github.com/ihs-programming/wikipedia-game.git` as the URI, which can also be found by clicking **Clone or download** on the [project page](https://github.com/ihs-programming/wikipedia-game).

## Commiting Changes
In order to commit your changes (upload them to Github), you'll need to ensure that you have a Github account and are added to the ihs-programming organization. 

## Code
The project is organized into a series of APIs to make coordination easier. You should make a new file in `/src/apis` and edit all your code there. This way, we reduce the likelihood of merge conflicts.
